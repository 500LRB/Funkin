# Compiling Friday Night Funkin' for Mobile Devices

This guide walks through the process of building for Android and iOS

## Android
0. Build the game for desktop to make sure everything works. Check [COMPILING.md](./COMPILING.md).
1. Run `setup-android-[yourOS].bat` in the docs folder to automatically download the required development kits on your machine.
      - If for some reason the downloads donâ€™t work (most likely JDK) [Download it directly.](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17)
      - (ONLY DO THIS STEP IF THE DOWNLOAD FAILED) After installing the JDK, make sure you know where it installed! If you installed using a `.msi` file, it should be somewhere around `C:\Program Files\`. Go and look for an`Eclipse Adoptium` folder and open it.
      - (ONLY DO THIS STEP IF THE DOWNLOAD FAILED) look for a folder named something like `jdk-17`. Right click and click on `Copy as path`.
      - (ONLY DO THIS STEP IF THE DOWNLOAD FAILED) Go to your command prompt and type `haxelib run lime config JAVA_HOME [JdkPathYouCopied]`
      - after that is done delete the `temp` folder that just got made.
